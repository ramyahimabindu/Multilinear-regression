# Multilinear-regression

This repository consists of two data sets- Start ups & Toyota Corolla. I have written it in Python. 

#libraries used

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

#Information

To check the relationship between features, I have made use of index plots. I have used Forward Selection process to see the effect of each and every feature with the dependent variable. To predict the accuracy, the threshold has been set to the standard value of 0.5. I have not made use of Feature Selection as simple linear and multiple linear regression does not need it. This is because the "regressor" takes care of the features. I have also caluclated RMSE value to measure the accuracy rate of the model. 

I have also used transformations to for fine tuning accuracy.
